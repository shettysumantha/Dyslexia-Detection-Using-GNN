It has become a major challenge for companies in industries such as banking, finance, retail, and e-commerce. Fraud can negatively impact an organization's financial performance and reputation, making it crucial for companies to prevent and predict suspicious activity.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n## Complex and evolving fraud patterns \n\nFraudsters continually revise their strategies and devise ever-more-sophisticated methods to cheat the system, regularly involving intricate networks of transactions to prevent recognition. Traditional rule-based systems and matrix-based ML such as SVMs and XGBoost often just ponder the immediate edges of a deal (who transferred money to whom), usually omitting to notice fraudulent patterns with more complicated context. Rule-based systems furthermore need to be manually adjusted as fraud patterns shift and new scams arise.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Label Quality\n\nThe datasets for fraud detection are commonly unbalanced and incompletely labeled. In reality, only a tiny fraction of people plan to perpetrate fraud. Usually, domain specialists will label transactions as fraudulent or not, but they can't make certain that all fraud has been identified in the dataset.\n\nThe large disparity between the number of labels and the amount of data available renders it hard to generate supervised models. Models trained on the accessible classifications could have a greater number of false negatives, while the imbalanced dataset could lead to an increase in false positives. Consequently, training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with different objectives and making use of their latent representations afterwards can be advantageous.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Model explainability \n\nPredicting if a transaction is fraudulent or not is inadequate for meeting the transparency standards of the banking sector. It is also essential to comprehend why certain deals are marked as deceitful. This explicability is critical for comprehending how fraud occurs, how to execute procedures to reduce fraud, and to make sure the process isn’t prejudiced. As a result, fraud detection models must be comprehensible and interpretable, which restricts the choices of models that investigators can apply.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Graph approaches for fraud detection\n\nTransactions can be represented as a graph, with users as nodes and interactions between them as edges. Traditional feature-based algorithms such as XGBoost and DLRM analyze individual nodes or edges, while graph-based approaches take into account the local context and structure of the graph, including neighboring nodes and edges.\n\nIn the traditional graph domain, there are various methods for making predictions based on graph structure, such as statistical approaches that aggregate features from adjacent nodes or edges. Algorithms like the [Louvain method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_method) and [InfoMap](https://towardsdatascience.com/infomap-algorithm-9b68b7e8b86) can identify communities and clusters of users on the graph. However, these methods lack the expressivity to fully consider the graph in its original format.\n\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) offer a solution by representing local structural and feature context natively within the model. Through aggregation and message passing, information from both edges and nodes is propagated to neighboring nodes. Multiple layers of graph convolution result in a node's state containing information from nodes multiple layers away, effectively allowing the GNN to have a \"receptive field\" of nodes or edges multiple jumps away from the node or edge in question.\n\nFor fraud detection, GNNs can account for complex or longer chains of transactions that fraudsters use for obfuscation. Additionally, changing patterns can be addressed by retraining the model iteratively.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## ML for graph \n\nThese are the general steps of ML on Graph, depending on the task, the methods used in each step may change and not all the steps may be needed.\n\n1. Graph Representation: The first step in applying machine learning techniques to graphs is to represent the graph in a format that can be input into a machine learning model. This can be done using various graph representations such as adjacency matrices, adjacency lists, and edge lists.\n\n2. Feature Extraction: Once the graph is represented, the next step is to extract features from the graph that can be used as input to a machine learning model. These features can include things like node degree, centrality measures, and graph traversal patterns.\n\n3. Dimensionality Reduction: As the number of nodes and edges in a graph can be large, it is often necessary to reduce the dimensionality of the graph representation before applying machine learning techniques. This can be done using techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) and t-SNE.\n\n4. Model Selection: After the graph is represented and features have been extracted, the next step is to select a machine learning model that can be applied to the graph data. Common models used for graph data include decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.\n\n5. Training and Evaluation: Once the model is selected, it is trained on the graph data using a labeled training dataset. The model is then evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its performance.\n\n6. Predictions: After the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new graph data. For example, it can be used to predict the likelihood of a node in a graph being in a certain class or to predict the likelihood of a link between two nodes.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dataset \nThe IBM credit card transaction dataset is a publicly available dataset that contains information about credit card transactions.

Transaction Data\nAny dataset that can be transformed into a graph can be used in our experimental setup. For our research, we used a real-life dataset to construct credit card transaction networks containing millions of transactions. This dataset includes information on the following features: anonymized identification of clients and merchants, merchant category code, country, monetary amount, time, acceptance, and fraud label. This real-life dataset is highly imbalanced and contains only 0.65% fraudulent transactions. Note that the demo data in this repository is artificaly generated for demonstration purposes. The Timeframes component derives the different timeframes for a rolling window setup given a step and window size.\n\n2. Graph Construction\nThe GraphConstruction component constructs the graphs that will be used by graph representation learners (e.g. FI-GRL and GraphSAGE) to learn node embeddings. We designed the credit card transaction networks as heterogeneous tripartite graphs containing client, merchant and transaction nodes. Because of this tripartite setup, representations can be learned for the transaction nodes. Only the transaction nodes are configured with node features.\n\n3. GraphSAGE\nThe HinSAGE code deploys a supervised, heterogeneous implementation of the GraphSAGE framework called HinSAGE, to learn embeddings of the transaction nodes in the aforementioned graphs.\n\n4. FI-GRL\nThe FIGRL code learns embeddings of the transaction nodes in the aforementioned graphs using the Fast Inductive Graph Representation Learning Framework. We call the Matlab implementation of FI-GRL from our Jupyter notebooks, which requires an appropriate installation of matlab.engine in the same folder as the notebooks. If you wish to run FI-GRL from Python, please run the following command in Matlab:\n\ncd (fullfile(matlabroot,'extern','engines','python'))\nsystem('python setup.py install')\n\nThis will generate a folder in matlabroot\\extern\\engines\\python\\build\\lib called 'matlab' please copy this folder and place it on the same location as the notebook from which you want to call matlab.engine. If you don't know your matlab root, running 'matlabroot' in Matlab will return the appropriate path.\n\n5. Classifier\nThe penultimate component in our pipeline uses the transaction node embeddings to classify the transaction nodes as fraudulent or legitimate. We chose to rely on XGBoost as a classification model, but other classifiers can easily be implemented.\n\n6. Evaluation\nThe Evaluation component contains functions for the Lift score, Lift curve and precision-recall curve. We focused on these evaluation metrics given the highly imbalanced nature of our dataset. However, this code can easily be extended to contain other evaluation metrics such as ROC plots.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#library installation\n!pip install inductiveGRL ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-01-16T21:08:59.215951Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-01-16T21:08:59.216406Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-01-16T21:09:41.666384Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-01-16T21:08:59.216369Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-01-16T21:09:41.664133Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# necessary imports of this part\nfrom inductiveGRL.graphconstruction import GraphConstruction\nfrom inductiveGRL.hinsage import HinSAGE_Representation_Learner","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-01-16T21:09:41.671665Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-01-16T21:09:41.672131Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-01-16T21:09:47.765858Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-01-16T21:09:41.672086Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-01-16T21:09:47.764945Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Global parameters:\nembedding_size = 64\nadd_additional_data = True","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-01-16T21:09:47.76982Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-01-16T21:09:47.771863Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-01-16T21:09:47.780728Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-01-16T21:09:47.771823Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-01-16T21:09:47.778742Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will split our data 70% to train_data and 30% for inductive data that will be used to test the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.\n\nFirst we calculate the cutoff point for the split using the formula \"cutoff = round(0.7*len(df))\" where 0.7 represents 70% of the data, and len(df) is the total number of rows in the dataframe.
